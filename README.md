#  🍹 Drink_Queue_Project

**A simple program written in Java** designed to teach and practice the following concepts:

-  How to turn abstract ideas (queue operations) into working code.
-  How to use arrays to store elements.
-  Polymorphism: A reference of type IQueue can point to any implementation.
-  Good practice: Interfaces are preferred over concrete classes for flexible design.
-  Encapsulation: Classes hide their internal data (e.g., queue state) and provide public methods.
-  Polymorphism: Methods like peek() and element() have the same purpose but different error behavior.
  

## 🏗️ Features

1. Drink.java - abstract base class.

2. Liquid.java - class for liquid ingredients (alcohol, juice).

3. SimpleDrink.java - drink with a single liquid.

4. StringQueue.java - implementation of a queue.

5. IQueue - describes the behavior of a queue for working with strings.

## 🛠️ How to use the program

**Cloning the code**:

1 class Drink:
```
package at.fhj.msd;
...

```

2 class Liquid
```
package at.fhj.msd;
...

```

3 class SimpleDrink
```
package at.fhj.msd;
...

```
4 class StringQueue
```
package at.fhj.msd;
...

```


5 public interface IQueue
```
package at.fhj.msd;
...

```

#### Compile the program:

```
bash
javac .............java
```

### Run the program:

```
bash
java ..........
```

## ⚔️ Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. 📝 Аdd main method.\
   ![example of a main method](./resources/images/main.png)
3. If you try to run the code without a main method you will get the following message in VSCODE\

4. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler. A compiler can be downloaded from here:
   [jetbrain](//www.jetbrains.com)

We recommend:
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
or
[Visual Studio Code](//www.jetbrains.com)

1. Run the `Calculator` to see the output of the code.

### 📊 Example Output

When you run the application, you will see an output similar to the following:\
![example](./resources/images/example.png)

### 🪜 Structure

Мake sure you have the proper structure to execute the code. See the example below.⬇️\

### Log4j2 Configuration

To enable logging in this project, ensure that you correctly configure the `log4j2.xml` file in the `src/main/resources` directory. A template file is included in the repository as `log4j2.xml.template`.
