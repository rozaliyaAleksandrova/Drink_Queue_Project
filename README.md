#  🍹 Drink_Queue_Project

**A simple program written in Java** designed to teach and practice the following concepts:

-  How to turn abstract ideas (queue operations) into working code.
-  How to use arrays to store elements.
-  Polymorphism: A reference of type IQueue can point to any implementation.
-  Good practice: Interfaces are preferred over concrete classes for flexible design.
-  Encapsulation: Classes hide their internal data (e.g., queue state) and provide public methods.
-  Polymorphism: Methods like peek() and element() have the same purpose but different error behavior.
  

## 🏗️ Features

1. Drink.java - abstract base class.

2. Liquid.java - class for liquid ingredients (alcohol, juice).

3. SimpleDrink.java - represents a drink with a single liquid.

4. StringQueue.java - implementation of a queue.

5. IQueue - describes the behavior of a queue for working with strings.

6. Main.java - a standard body of a Main class.

7. Cocktail.java - represents a cocktail drink consisting of multiple liquid ingredients.

8. DrinkQueue.java - implementing Drink interface in a queue.

## ⚔️Getting Started


1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
   
**To clone this project, run:**

```
bash git clone https://github.com/rozaliyaAleksandrova/Drink_Queue_Project 
```
Or copy the code from the README.md link you are currently reading.


2. 📝 Аdd main method.\
   ![example of a main method](./resources/images/Main.png)
3. If you try to run the code without a main method you will get the following message in VSCODE

4. Compile the Java files using a Java compiler. A compiler can be downloaded from here:
   [jetbrain](//www.jetbrains.com)

We recommend:
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
or
[Visual Studio Code](//www.jetbrains.com)

[Problems with the installation? Click here!](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started.html)

1. Run the `main()` method in the Main class to see the output of the code.

### 📊 Example Output

When you run the application, you will see an output similar to the following:

## 🎊 How to make the code more interesting 🎊

You can create the drinks in your main() method in the Main class and then call the method:

[Download example from here!](./resources/images/Main_class_example.md)



## Test your code 


 Create drinks in your main() method in the Main class and then call the method to test whether individual classes are working correctly:
